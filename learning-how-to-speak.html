      Learning how to&nbsp;speak
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">January 01, 2016</span>

    <p>I didn&#8217;t really talk before I was 4 years old. In fact, I learned how to read before I could converse with others. According to my parents, a doctor said that I would have to attend a special school for not knowing how to speak&nbsp;properly.</p>
<p>Some kind of speech impediment carried on through the beginning of high school. I stuttered whenever I was in social situations, even the most casual ones, and still do occasionally. The following is a list of things that have particularly helped me overcome&nbsp;stuttering.</p>
<p><strong>Joining the debate team</strong>. I wanted to <em>decimate</em> my stuttering. The first time I walked into the debate classroom, I watched our school&#8217;s two senior A-debaters <em>spread</em>, or &#8220;speed read&#8221;, about nuclear weapon possession policies at over 300 <span class="caps">WPM</span>.</p>
<p><em>(Aside: The reason why debaters talk really fast is because their speeches are time-constrained, and they need to develop arguments as efficiently as possible. This is the nearly </em>pure-logos<em> model of debate that is present in many competitive debate circuits. Some people think it is bad, and others think it is good. I would argue that it is good because it fosters critical thinking skills (the human brain can process up to 800 <span class="caps">WPM</span>, <span class="caps">BTW</span>), creates time for arguments to be developed more thoroughly, and even if there were a good reason for it being bad, the best debaters still have to &#8220;adapt&#8221; their style to the many &#8220;lay&#8221; judges who prefer more pathos and slower talking&nbsp;anyway.)</em></p>
<p>I thought debate was cool. It was a domain outside of the sciences that I wasn&#8217;t good at yet (I was terrible for a while), and it was very competitive. The camaraderie and trophies were thrilling, and I got to be out of town nearly every weekend. <strong>I ended up qualifying for debate nationals in 12th grade and <a href="https://youtu.be/jawI1nBR_9E?t=6m57s" target="_blank">teaching high schoolers</a> how to debate</strong> at <span class="caps">UT</span> Austin&#8217;s camp that summer, so it was an early resume-padder&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Due to the research that debate evidence required, I picked up a lot of random domain knowledge in politics, philosophy and argumentation. Most importantly though, it helped me to be a more logical and persuasive communicator, a trait that has become indispensible in my career. <strong>From speaking to recruiters to career fair, talking my way through techincal interviews with engineers, to making friends in college</strong>, I would have a significantly different experience if it weren&#8217;t for speech and&nbsp;debate.</p>
<p><strong>Playing games</strong>. My friends introduced the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)" target="_blank">Taboo</a> to me in 12th grade, and I was hooked. Players have their partners guess the word on the player&#8217;s card without using the word itself or five additional words listed on the card. I liked it a lot because it forced me to describe ideas with both time and strict word constraints. I also started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Phrase_(game)" target="_blank">Catch Phrase</a> last summer, which has similar rules with more lax constraints. I have had a lot of fun with this game in particular, so much that I&#8217;ve been itching to code it up or discuss various tactics in&nbsp;depth.</p>
<p>Finally, I came up with this sort of ironic game while my girlfriend and I were out for dinner. While waiting for her, I went to the first link when  Googling &#8220;funny long jokes&#8221;. This &#8220;game&#8221; involves looking up a funny long joke (typically a story), summarizing it in your head, recalling its details without referencing the text, and delivering it (even embellishing it) in a way that people will &#8220;get&#8221;. It&#8217;s fantastic because it&#8217;s fun socializing practice (however shallow it is ðŸ˜›), and it also builds up your short-term&nbsp;memory.  </p>
<p><em>Can you think of other ways to improve&nbsp;speech?</em></p>

    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">May 09, 2018</span>

    <p>Day 1 of big post-grad Asia trip: 15-hour layover in <span class="caps">LAX</span> (planned purposefully, in case my <span class="caps">AUS</span>-<span class="caps">LAX</span> leg before Hong Kong got delayed, which it&nbsp;didn&#8217;t!)</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;plane</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m only carrying the Daypack part of my Osprey Farpoint 55 and a carry on-sized piece of&nbsp;luggage.</li>
<li>Had an entire row to&nbsp;myself!</li>
<li>Delta&#8217;s in-flight entertainment screen, despite people owning stuff on their phones and laptops instead (I&#8217;m convinced other airlines have given up completely on this) is awesome. Tried to watch <em>12 Strong</em> (which was good so far, but wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for it), but I saw the guy in the seat across from me watching <em>Happy Death Day</em>, which looked much funnier, realized I was too tired to watch anything anyway and fell asleep. Then I watched an episode of Bong Appétit from <span class="caps">VICELAND</span>, which is about infusing weed into foods as varied as Texas <span class="caps">BBQ</span> and sashimi. I don&#8217;t actually smoke or get high regularly, but it was pretty&nbsp;interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon &#8220;hopping (sic) off the plane at <span class="caps">LAX</span>&#8221; - saw the guy who was across the aisle from me blast &#8220;Party in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span>A.&#8221; by Miley Cyrus and taking a video for his Snap&nbsp;story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had trouble finding reputable, reasonably-priced luggage storage for my one carry-on at first, and then I found Bagbnb, which is like Airbnb but for storing your luggage! There was a stopping point about a 15-min walk from Venice Beach, which is where I wanted to&nbsp;go.</p>
</li>
<li>Abbot Kinney Blvd is one of the most charming blocks I&#8217;ve ever walked&nbsp;down</li>
<li>When I was walking along the houses lining the beachfront, I overheard this British-sounding lady telling this older American man, &#8220;so that&#8217;s the point of the blockchain, which is what Bitcoin is based upon, &#8230;&#8221;. I wanted to keep listening, but didn&#8217;t want to interrupt two&nbsp;people.</li>
<li>Everyone here is dressed so well (that may be because I&#8217;m walking around Venice)! Felt like a tourist in my Asics and beige (<em>non-cargo</em>)&nbsp;shorts.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m currently writing this from Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop in Venice. It&#8217;s fucking awesome, from the lemongrass chicken salad I got, to the music they&#8217;re playing (a lot of music I haven&#8217;t heard of before, and also Yelle and <span class="caps">HAIM</span>), and the general vibes of the&nbsp;place.</li>
<li>Intelligentsia Coffee in&nbsp;Venice</li>
<li>
<p>The Albright on the Santa Monica&nbsp;Pier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Lyft driver from the Bagbnb stop to the <span class="caps">LAX</span> was a Lebanese man who had a lot to say about the economy and how things used to be in California. Turns out he is also familiar with the works Nassim Nicholas&nbsp;Taleb!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Random observations from my 15-hour layover in <span class="caps">LAX</span> today (I spent most of that time around Venice and Santa&nbsp;Monica):</p>
<ul>
<li>I used this service called &#8220;Bagbnb&#8221; to reserve space for the small carry-on I brought with me. I only paid $6 for the whole day of storage, and the dropoff site was the office of a neat coworking space, which was walking distance from Venice&nbsp;Beach</li>
<li>Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice is one of the most charming shopping blocks I&#8217;ve ever been&nbsp;to</li>
<li>Bird (those electric scooters) is ubiquitous in Santa Monica (where the company is based out&nbsp;of)</li>
<li>My Lyft driver from my Bagbnb to <span class="caps">LAX</span> was a Lebanese man who had a lot of insights about the economy, plus he was familiar with the author of one of the books I&#8217;m currently reading (Taleb, who is also Lebanese). It&#8217;s especially refreshing when I&#8217;m traveling solo and haven&#8217;t had any social interaction outside&nbsp;of </li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff I&#8217;m working&nbsp;on</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished the prologue of <em>Antifragile</em></li>
<li>Listened to an episode of Software Engineering Daily (Crypto Pump and&nbsp;Dump)</li>
<li>Worked a bit on connecting the Google Sheets <span class="caps">API</span> to Seekr&#8217;s backend <span class="caps">API</span> to affect the order of items on this endpoint: <a href="https://api.seekrtravel.com/listings/_landing"><span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;Endpoint</a></li>
